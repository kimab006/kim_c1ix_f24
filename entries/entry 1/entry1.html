  <h1 id="head" class="righteous-regular"> Week one was a mix of ethereal limerance, bittersweet mountain, old school rock supernatural, quirky garage band, and chill floaty.</h1>
  
  <p id="day0"> The past five days were still contributing to my transition into second year. Depending on my mood I had to listen to calming music, motivation rock, or songs that wouldn't stress me out more than I already am. </p>
  <p id="day1"> Day 1: I was stressed beyond belief which led to artists like Clairo, Beabadoobee, Suki Waterhouse, and The Marias. "you listened to mulled cider and charming on tuesdays in the evenings. Here's some ethereal, limerence, power ballad, dreamy, and yearning"</p>
  <p id="day2"> Day 2: I felt extremely homesick and chose to listen to songs that would bring me back to Pennsylvannia and driving around in my car. This led to artists like Noah Kahan, Bon Iver, The Beatles, and Fleetwood Mac. "You listened to british invasion and hippie in the early mornings. Here is some mountain, granola vies, bittersweet, forest, rainy day, and indie folk"</p>
  <p id="day3"> Day 3: I needed to walk home at night and get energized to see some friends which brought about Billy Idol, Boston, Bruce Springsteen and The B-52's. "You listened to 80s and retro on Thursdays at night. Here's some old school rock, guitar rock, vintage rock, retro rock, 70s rock and supernatural"</p>
  <p id="day4"> Day 4: I felt relatively relieved the week was ending and my music reflected this mood. I listened to the Wallows, HUNNY, Peach Pit, Saint Motel, and The Killers. "You listened to surf rock and quirky on Fridays in the morning. Here's some: quirky, garage band, surf rock, coming of age, indie surf, and indie" </p>
  <p id="day5"> Day 5: As it was the end of the week I was able to relax and transport myself outside of my day to day problems. I listened to Steve Lacy, Dominic Fike, Frank Ocean, and Tame Impala. "You listened to hip hop and rhymes on Fridays at night. Here's some floaty, chill, make out, beach, night drive, and alternative r&b" </p>
