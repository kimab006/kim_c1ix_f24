  <h2> Week Four was a mix of soul wedding, solitude downtown vibes, pining sad girl, floaty masterpiece, and solitude britpop.</h2>

  <div class="content"> 
    <p> Day 1: soul wedding. A mix of Norah Jones, Stevie Wonder, Etta James, and Billy Joel seems to help with my sudden build up of stress. I grew up on Norah Jones's Don't Know Why while falling asleep leaning on my mother's shoulder. For me this type of slow relaxing, wedding, timeless, golden oldies, and dinner acoustic has me softening enough to think I can handle everything thrown at me.</p>
    <p> Day 2: solitude downtown vibes. A mix of catholic rosary, optimistic, solitude, and mysterious with artists like The Cranberries, The Smiths, TV Girl, and more. I tend to listen to music that allows me to relax, but also gives me some positive hope. This type of music makes me feel comfortable and at peace even though I know I have fifty million assignments due the next week, and several midterms to take.</p>
    <p> Day 3: pining sad girl. A mix of alternative, rocking on, pining, unrequited love, yearning, and autumn morning, and more. This playlist is for the feelings of frustration with not being able to be in control of all the things that are out of it. Usually when I'm in this kind of mood my go tos are Chappel Roan, Boygenius, Lana Del Rey, and Phoebe Bridgers.</p>
    <p> Day 4: floaty masterpiece. A mix of floaty, dream rap, masterpiece, collaboration hip hop, and more. Towards the end of the week I needed some classic Tyler the Creator, Asap Rocky, Frank Ocean, Brent Faiyaz, and more. This collection of artists allows me to feel better about being stressed, and kicks me into high gear for whatever next thing I tackle.</p>
    <p> Day 5: solitude britpop. A mix of quiet, autumn, britpop, solitude, art rock, permanent wave, and melancholic. Tonight I wanted to listen to Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, and The Smiths. With this curated playlist, I was able to get my favorites all in one for the specific mood of relief the week is over, and calm quiet.</p>
