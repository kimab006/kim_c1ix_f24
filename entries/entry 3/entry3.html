    <h1 class="doto-h1"> Week Three: As a person I can feel myself slowly grow from who I was yesterday, a month ago, or even five years ago. For me I lost a couple of connections I had at home to people, and it made me realize it is all part of the grand scheme of how I grow as a person and develop into who I'm supposed to be. This week was a mix of trippy psychedelic rock, retro 80s, quirky surf rock, cowboy country mountain, and guitar rock rocking. All of these genres make up my nostalgic foundations of being. I listened to all of these types of music growing up to who I am today, and felt like reminiscing. </h1>

      <p> Day 1: trippy psychedelic rock. Here's to laid back psychedelic rock, trippy 00s, indie, hipster, indie disco, and indie rock. Throwback to my intro to Pink Floyd Junior year of high school.</p>
      <p> Day 2: retro 80s pop. Here's to 80s, timeless, retro, 80s pop, 80s movies, 20th century, and 80s rock to reminisce on times from eighth grade when the only rock in knew was Duran Duran and Van Halen.</p>
      <p> Day 3: quirky surf rock. Here's to surf rock, pov: indie, indie surf, garage band, and hipster. These genres bring me back to times of online classes during covid listening to Peach Pit, Cage the Elephant, and Hippo Campus when all I wanted was summer hangouts with friends. </p>
      <p> Day 4: cowboy country mountain. Here's to cowboy, twang, country, mountain, red dirt, soft country, and granola vibes. I really did not get into country until my senior year of high school. For me this brings back nostalgic memories of backyard grad parties, summer flings, and saying goodbye to home for the first time. </p>
      <p> Day 5: guitar rock rocking. Here's to 80s synthpop, guitar rock, rock and roll, vintage rock, pure rock, old school rock, and rocking on. Rock music has always been a constant in my life, though I've evolved to expanding my knowledge across all decades since when I first started listening to the genre. Now it stands as a fundamental reminder I'll always be able to keep some parts of me from years ago. This particular subgenre is filled with Pearl Jam, RHCP, Billy Idol, REM, and Stone Temple Pilots from freshman year of college. </p>
